   ```

## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all functions
- Keep functions focused and modular

```python
def analyze_metagenome(fastq_file: str, output_dir: str) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze metagenomic sequencing data.
    
    Args:
        fastq_file: Path to input FASTQ file
        output_dir: Directory for output files
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

#### R
- Follow tidyverse style guide
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex operations
- Use pipe operator (`%>%`) for data manipulation

```r
# Analyze metabolomics data
analyze_metabolomics <- function(data_file, output_path) {
  # Read and process data
  metabolite_data <- read_csv(data_file) %>%
    filter(!is.na(concentration)) %>%
    group_by(compound) %>%
    summarise(mean_conc = mean(concentration))
  
  # Save results
  write_csv(metabolite_data, output_path)
  
  return(metabolite_data)
}
```

### Documentation Standards

- Write clear, concise documentation
